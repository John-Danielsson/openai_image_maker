# openai_image_maker

Type in a prompt to make an image, and this app will improve upon your prompt using prompt engineering to make an even cooler image than you expected.

## How to use it?

I assume you are proficient with Python and software development in general.

1) Open ```test.py``` in an IDE of your choice.
2) In the ```openai_image_maker``` directory, type in ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the Terminal.
2) Upload an audio file of your voice prompt to the ```voice_prompts``` folder.
3) In ```test.py```, change the line ```audio_file_path = "voice_prompts/example.m4a"``` to the name of
your newly added voice prompt. The new line should look like this: ```audio_file_path = "voice_prompts/new_example.m4a"```.
4) Run the program. It should print a list of URLs (in the Terminal)of images generated by the DALL-E API.
