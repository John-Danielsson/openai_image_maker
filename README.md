# OpenAI Image Maker

This app lets you generate images with DALL-E using voice prompts.

## How to use it?

I assume you are proficient with Python and software development in general.

I do not know what your setup is like, but these steps are a good general guideline.

1) Open ```test.py``` in an IDE of your choice.
2) Type in ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the Terminal. Make sure your Terminal's PWD is the ```openai_image_maker``` directory.
3) Upload an audio file of your voice prompt to the ```voice_prompts``` folder. From OpenAI documentation: "File uploads are currently limited to 25 MB and the following input file types are supported: ```mp3```, ```mp4```, ```mpeg```, ```mpga```, ```m4a```, ```wav```, and ```webm```." \[[1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text)\]
4) In ```test.py```, change the line ```audio_file_path = "voice_prompts/example.m4a"``` to the name of
your newly added voice prompt. The new line should look like this: ```audio_file_path = "voice_prompts/new_example.m4a"```.
5) Make a ```.env``` file with your OpenAI API token in it, in the ```openai_image_maker``` directory. It needs to follow this format:

```OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key here>```

6) Run the program. It should print a list of URLs (in the Terminal)of images generated by the DALL-E API.
